# KODA EUDR 2.0 — incremental staging candidate

Status: 2026-10-06, staging source only. Production has not been updated.

The package extends the supplied vanilla HTML/CSS/JS → Netlify Function → signed Apps Script bridge → Google Sheet/Drive/Calendar architecture. It contains complete Apps Script service files, frontend files, configuration templates and 40 mocked service/security test groups. It does not certify EUDR compliance or submit an official declaration.

## Run locally

Node.js >=20, no npm dependency installation required.

```bash
npm test
npm run check
python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory public
```

Static server previews only the frontend shell. Authenticated workflows require the real staging Netlify proxy and Google backend; tests mock those services. Local browser UI QA could not be run in the audit environment.

## Package layout

- apps_script/: complete changed backend files and manifest.
- netlify/functions/call.mjs: signed server proxy and personal identity registry.
- public/: existing vanilla stack, official KODA logo and expanded workspace.
- evidence/: observed Sheet snapshot, exact final schema, endpoint map, QA output, source register and migration/QA checklist.
- changes.patch: textual diff against supplied baseline (logo binary included separately).
- backups/: unchanged source ZIP + checksum. This is not a retrieved backup of the live Apps Script project.

## Configuration

- **Spreadsheet ID**: `1xura5W6coeGeJsc1zQMP6Emw_QMTv5XAf0bqpC5Uk3A`. Production observed; replace with staging copy ID.
- **Drive Root Folder ID**: `1BWXpf-L6yBPQtXbskoQKMfN890aZXCJg`. Real folder verified from 09_CONFIG; use dedicated staging root.
- **Google Calendar ID**: `44c53155b661c93b06c6ee49bd9cce5764a91fa80cc57c805de639d3483cfce2@group.calendar.google.com`. Not visible to current connector account; test deploying account separately.
- **Netlify production URL**: `https://koda-eudr-system.netlify.app/`. Read-only inspection, no deployment.
- **ALLOWED_ORIGINS**: `Exact staging URL in both Netlify and Apps Script`. No wildcard; production origin only after release.
- **APPS_SCRIPT_WEBAPP_URL**: `New staging /exec deployment URL`. Netlify environment; live project was not retrieved.
- **DB_ID / ROOT_ID / CALENDAR_ID**: `Staging Sheet / Drive / Calendar IDs`. Apps Script properties; do not call prepared-sheet reconnect helpers.
- **BRIDGE_SECRET**: `Fresh random >=32 characters`. Same server-side secret in Netlify + Apps Script; never in frontend.
- **TOKEN_HASHES_JSON**: `SHA-256 personal token registry`. Netlify only: sha256, email, active, expires_at; distinct tokens >=32 random characters.
- **ALLOW_PILOT_ADMIN**: `false`. Shared pilot credential disabled by default.
- **TIME_ZONE / FRONTEND_URL**: `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh / exact staging URL`. Set Google calendar timezone and Sheet 09_CONFIG explicitly.
- **Legal settings**: `NOT_REVIEWED until human verification`. LEGAL_RULE_VERSION, ANNEX_I_VERSION, COUNTRY_RISK_VERSION, LAST_LEGAL_REVIEW_DATE, LEGAL_REVIEWED_BY.

## Staged deployment and rollback

### 1. Capture production backup

Retrieve actual current Apps Script project files and manifest, deployment version/settings, Sheet values/formulas/format/protections, Drive inventory/ACLs and Calendar event mapping. Export Netlify/GAS settings securely outside Git. Supplied ZIP is a source backup, not independent proof of live deployed script code.

### 2. Create Git branch

Use the actual existing repository once its URL/access is supplied; create upgrade/eudr-v2-staging. Apply staging/ contents to repository root. Preserve backup ZIP outside deploy root. Do not create a competing production repository or replace hosting providers.

### 3. Create isolated Google staging

Copy current Sheet including auxiliary tabs and any formulas; use a dedicated staging Drive root and Calendar. Ensure the deploying owner is an existing active ADMIN in the staging user table. Do not test with production IDs.

### 4. Install complete Apps Script files

Replace project files with all supplied .gs files and appsscript.json. Set DB_ID, ROOT_ID, CALENDAR_ID, BRIDGE_SECRET, ALLOWED_ORIGINS to staging values in Script properties. Do not run attachPreparedSheet/reconnectPreparedSheet/setupFromProperties against copied production data.

### 5. Run additive migration

Run migrateV2() manually as active Admin on the backed-up staging copy. It validates all header prefixes before mutation; abort SCHEMA_MISMATCH without repair. Expect 21 modeled tables + preserved auxiliary tabs 12 and 13 = 23 visible tabs. Read back exact schema, records and preserved cells. Status mapping is a material data change and requires rollback snapshot.

### 6. Configure APIs and policy

Enable Advanced Calendar v3 and required Google Calendar/Drive APIs in the linked Cloud project; authorize expanded scopes as owner. Update 09_CONFIG FRONTEND_URL and timezone for staging. Keep RULES_CONFIRMED=NO and legal versions NOT_REVIEWED until a named human reviews current authoritative texts and policy.

### 7. Deploy staging Apps Script

Create a separate staging web-app deployment executing as the authorized owner. If anonymous endpoint exposure is used for Netlify, permit it only with mandatory signed bridge requests; doPost has no unauthenticated action path. Record exact /exec URL and Google deployment settings.

### 8. Configure Netlify staging

Deploy the Git branch to an isolated staging site or controlled branch deploy. Keep publish=public, functions=netlify/functions, no framework build. Set APPS_SCRIPT_WEBAPP_URL, fresh BRIDGE_SECRET, exact ALLOWED_ORIGINS and TOKEN_HASHES_JSON; ALLOW_PILOT_ADMIN=false. Origin must match Apps Script exactly.

### 9. Issue scoped personal credentials

Create users/suppliers and assignments in staging as Admin. Generate random personal credentials outside chat, store only SHA-256 + email + active/expiry in Netlify registry, and provide tokens to each user through an authorized secure channel. Admin web management does not generate tokens or send invitations.

### 10. Adopt legacy evidence deliberately

Map known SO25-2183 and exact folder IDs to reviewed database records before allowing a duplicate create. Do not infer EUDR25-06780 equals KODA SO; do not fuzzy-match folder names. Preserve originals and verify original sharing ACLs before supplier rollout. No automatic legacy-record adoption tool is supplied.

### 11. Complete real QA

Run pending matrix and capture API request IDs, before/after Sheet rows, folder/file hashes, event IDs, screenshots and supplier isolation attempts. Test 17.8 MB PDF under the 25-second proxy timeout; inspect quota/memory failure recovery and export caps. The 40 mock tests do not substitute for these checks.

### 12. Release production incrementally

Only after staging QA, business/legal review and migration verification: take a fresh production backup, revalidate schema/config/ACLs, migrate the real Sheet, deploy matching GAS and Netlify versions through existing GitHub pipeline, rotate any temporary credentials and verify production URLs without public rollout until acceptance.

### 13. Rollback

Restore matching original code, deployment versions, configuration and the pre-migration Sheet snapshot together. Old code may not understand uppercase statuses and new relationships. Do not erase newly uploaded originals or audit history; reconcile post-release records into a retained archive before restoring a snapshot.

## Known limits and release gates

- Distinct personal token login is implemented; Google SSO/OTP/self-service credential issuance is not.
- Only PDF, PNG, JPG, JSON and GeoJSON evidence is accepted; SO and product image inputs are limited to 3 MiB each. Evidence and processed PDF chunk transfers support up to 25 MiB.
- Full in-app ZIP source size is capped at 23 MiB; larger case packages require selected exports or a separately implemented asynchronous export path.
- Plot geometry supports points and single-ring polygons only; holes, MultiPolygon and antimeridian crossing are held for specialist review. Source precision is declared and human-reviewed; it is never fabricated.
- N-level lineage supports MDF/veneer forest-origin gaps; quantitative wood mixing, allocation and mass-balance validation is not implemented.
- Assignment operates at order and individual task scope; no independent material/block assignment table. Notifications cover assignments/review/expiry events, without scheduled overdue notices or mentions.
- Sheet audit is append-only through the app, not tamper-proof against Google Sheet owners. Supplier app scope does not override previously shared Drive ACLs.
- Ready-for-operator-review is an internal evidence state. Legal baseline, Annex I, production-country benchmarking and source assertions require human review.
- Repository URL/access, actual Apps Script project access, Netlify deployment permission, target Calendar access and real staging QA remain necessary before release. Do not post secrets in chat.

## UI revision on this staging package

The visual shell, sign-in, dashboard, Orders register, and order summary have been redesigned. The dashboard now gives a real empty state when no order exists, shows action priorities from registered tasks, and separates evidence progress from legal compliance. Orders have immediate search and collapsible advanced filters. Existing backend and Apps Script files are unchanged. This is still a staging candidate; production deployment and real Google-backed UI QA remain pending.
